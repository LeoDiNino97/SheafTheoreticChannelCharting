## Dependencies

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python dependency management and [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as the task runner.

### Install prerequisites

Install the required tools:

- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just#installation)

Follow the installation instructions from their official documentation.

### Setup the development environment

From the project root, run:

```bash
just setup
```

The `setup` recipe will:

- Create the `.venv` virtual environment (if it does not exist)
- Install all project dependencies using `uv`

After the command completes, the development environment will be ready to use. 🚀
